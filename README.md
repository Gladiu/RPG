My first OpenGL game.
It is supposed to be rpg game with open world.

Compiling
```
cmake -S source/ -B build/
cd build
make
```
Required dependency
OpenGl 3.3
SOIL
GLFW3

You also need to install cglm
cglm https://github.com/recp/cglm


Currently only runs on linux but windows support will be added.

You are free to do whatever you want with this code.
